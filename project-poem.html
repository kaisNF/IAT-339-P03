                <p>The man, who arrived in a strange and unfamiliar
                    place and was unable to find a sense of acceptance,
                    found comfort in the surrounding nature - the grass,
                    trees, river, and the beautiful songs of the birds.
                    He questioned why society could not show the same degree of compassion and kindness.

                <p>As a director, I have met with my team multiple of times on a weekly basis to go over the vision for our poem video.
                    I had an overview of the shots we are planned to take and helped assembling the shot list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I learned in the pre production phase is how to handle change in a rapid manner. Also, to always have different plans for shoots 
                    in case complications arise.

                <h1>Challenges<span class="multitext"></span></h1>
                <p>I had many difficulties while working on this project, including the need to adjust our video poem to the constantly shifting weather, which necessitated rearranging the settings and shots to meet the screenplay. 

                    Additionally, in order to maintain continuity throughout the entire project, I had to master colour grading in greater depth. 
                    As a director, I had to keep an eye on everything and make sure that everything was proceeding according to the shot list while also taking care of other projects. This was something that I found challenging.

                <h1>Reflection<span class="multitext"></span></h1>
                <p>Being a director behind a poem video does come with its challanges. As I had to follow an artistic style of composition rather than a linear and continous
                    one like the narrative films, but with the help of my team's collaboration we figured out how to over come our challanages
                </p>
                <p>An issue we came across mutiple of time was how to make this peotic video inresting and at the same time educational</p>
                <p>After finishing this project i learned how to create more creative videos wihtout a script. Also, I have learned how to edit
                    montages, Keyframing, Keylighting and alternative sound designing

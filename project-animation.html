                <h1>"Arthuer the Devilish Angel"</h1>
                <p>Project description: We are aiming to create an animated short around one minute and thirty seconds long. Our main goal is to build a tense, horror like atmosphere, but eventually transition away to create a heart-warming story. Our animationâ€™s current concept is following an evil ghost during his daily life and tasks. The audience starts to notice a change of behavior as he stumbles on virtuous opportunities, through that we see changes in his physical form and environment due to the good deeds he has done.

                <h1>Modeling<span class="multitext"></span></h1>
                <p>With the help of my teammates, I have contributed in brainstorming the 
                    main character, the environment and the objects for our short animation.
                    Then I proceeded in modeling some parts of the main character rig 
                    and the objects
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I learned in this part of the project was how to have a main character 
                    that is modeled effectivly to be moved around the scenes.

                <h1>Animating the environment<span class="multitext"></span></h1>
                <p>A took care of the light setup of the animation, as our vision was to have a blueish/greenish tone to the animation, as well as focusing on using shadows and silhouettes to match the atmosphere we wanted the audience to perceive.                </p>

                <h1>Editing, Lighting and Sound Design</h1>
                <p>Finally, I sound designed and color corrected the animation in post production using FL Studio,  Adobe audition and Adobe after effects so that all the sound effects and music would fit the storyline and the unfolding events.

                <h1>Reflection<span class="multitext"></span></h1>
                <p>During my time in this project I have learned so much about animation, and that is because we came across 
                    a lot of issues we had to fix. Personally, I came across issues with the rigging of the main character 
                    as I had to go back and forth from animating and fixing the model's skeleton at the same time.
                </p>
                <p>Also, I have learned how to work effectively with a team in a project like this. As communication was the main aspect to have a good result. By communicating in a regular and precise manner we were able to create the final result that got a high graded mark and appreciation for classmates and professors
